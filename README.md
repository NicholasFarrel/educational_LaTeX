# 📚 educational_LaTeX

This repository contains a collection of educational PDFs I created using LaTeX during my years as a teacher in Brazil. All materials are written in **Portuguese**, as they were developed for use in Brazilian classrooms and tutoring sessions.

These resources are designed to support both **conceptual understanding (theory)** and **hands-on practice (application)** across various subjects.

## 🗂️ What's Inside

- 📖 Theory summaries and concept explanations  
- 🛠️ Application exercises and problem sets  
- 🧾 Cleanly formatted LaTeX PDFs, ready to use or adapt

All files are final PDFs — no compilation needed.

## 🚀 Usage

Simply browse the repository and download the PDFs you'd like to use or share. These materials are ideal for:

- Classroom instruction  
- Tutoring and private sessions  
- Independent learning  
- Building your own teaching resources
